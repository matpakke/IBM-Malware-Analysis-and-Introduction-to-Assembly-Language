# Course overview
Welcome to the Malware Analysis and Introduction to Assembly course.

Through video demonstrations, hands-on reverse engineering, and capture-the-flag activities, you will be introduced to the processes and methods for conducting malware analysis of different common file types. You will analyze native executable files, and analyze popular files like PowerShell, JavaScripts, and macro-enabled documents.

Then you will learn the fundamentals of Assembly language, basic Win32 Assembly programming concepts, and how Reverse Engineers use Assembly to analyze malware.

## Prerequisites

Having knowledge in the following areas is helpful for this course:

- Basic understanding of an operating system, such as, file system, registry system, and processes

- General programming knowledge is desirable      

## Videos and Demos

As you're going through the content, pay close attention to the tools and files that are used to demonstrate different analytic tools. You will use these in your VM environment and capture the flag exercises.

## Virtual Machine

To safely run the provided course sample files, which emulate malware, you will need to set up a virtual machine environment. The steps for this are covered in module 2, but if you prefer, you can set up the lab after reviewing all of the videos and exercises first. 

## Badge

At the completion of this course, you will earn the Malware Analysis and Introduction to Assembly Language badge.

# Common use cases of malware analysis

## Malware detection
- Malware analysis provides IoCs (file hashes, C2) for identification
- Some security products detect malware behavior or by unique signatures

## Incident response engagements
- Suspected artifacts (files, logs, memory) are analyzed
- Determine how identified attack components work

## Threat Hunting

- Hunt for similar
threats based on malware behavior

- Save time from re-analyzing similar malware

- Identify new technologies utilized by malware

# Types of Malware Analysis

| Static Analysis                                      | Dynamic Analysis                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Analysis without running                            | Analysis by running code in a controlled environment |
| Speculate behavior from text strings found in the file | Observe behavior while running the file (file system, processes, registry, network, hardware) |
| Use a disassembler or a decompiler to reverse-engineer a binary | Use disassembler, decompiler, and debugger to reverse-engineer a binary |
| Code and data not easily seen if obfuscated         | Code and data executed                               |

# Stages in conducting malware analysis

![Stages in conducting malware analysis](../gallery/stanges%20in%20conducting%20malware%20analysis.png)

**Fully Automated**
- run sample in sandbox and analyze logs

**Static Properties**
- identify IoCs from file properties and strings

**Interactive Behavior**
- run sample in controlled environment while monitoring syste, changes at runtime

**Manual code reversing**
- debug the malware and understand capabilities that might not be shown during automated and interctive analysis
